user to signup/signin and play the game.

Steps followed:

Designed a simple game board display to start with.

Focused on one MVP at a time. Finish coding and testing it.

Move to next MVP. Adding next feature introduced bugs. Correct them and test
again.

Problems faced:

I started my game baord with HTML tables and columns and connected with nested
array in javascript. I finished the game logic without having a look at API.
API had one dimensional array set-up. I changed my game board to Bootstrap
and has one dimensional arary in javascript to match with API set-up.

Unsolved issues:

My gameboard is not responsive as I expected.

Game page dosen't restrict multi user logging in with same id and show
unexpected behavior
